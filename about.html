            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Sindhu Yamparala, a computer science student at SRM AP.</p>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. My journey into the world of programming started when I was about 12, and I have been passionate about it ever since.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am focusing on Web Development, and I have taken Front-End Development courses with IBM Skills Build. I have also worked on an interesting project, Alum Connect.</p>
            <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading books (strictly fictional), which help me stay creative and think outside the box.</p>
            <p>I really enjoy music and occasionally try my hand at cooking and baking.</p>
            <p>I love traveling, partly because I like trying new cuisines and desserts.</p>
            <h2>Future Aspirations:</h2>
            <p>In the future, I aspire to be a full-stack developer, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to check out my projects and contact me if you have any questions or opportunities.</p>
